### What are we case solving?
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts. The program finds the number in less than 20 attempts. If this condition is not met, 0 points are awarded for this and all other conditions.

**Competition condition:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 1 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant "write a program that guesses a number"

**Quality metric:**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions. It is necessary to achieve a minimum number of attempts.

**What we practice?:**
- Learning to write good code on the python
- Learning to work with IDE
- Learning to work with GitHub

### Bref information about the data
....

### Result
The algorithm guesses the number in an average of: 6 attempts
