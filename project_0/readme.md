### What are we case solving?
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Competition condition:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess", it means "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater or less than the one we need.

**Quality metric:**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts to pass with 100 repetitions

**What we practice?:**
Learning to write good code on the python
